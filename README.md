# Problem Background
Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) serves Washington, D.C., and parts of its metropolitan area, operating over 700 stations and managing a fleet of 5,400 bikes as of January 2023. These automated bike rentals enhance urban mobility, reduce environmental impact, and promote health. Since its launch in 2010, CaBi has generated a wealth of data on user behavior and traffic patterns, offering invaluable insights for urban planning and transportation optimization.
Despite its success, CaBi faces challenges in efficiently managing its extensive network of stations and bikes. The unpredictable nature of bike demand, influenced by variables such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal changes, complicates resource allocation. Without accurate demand forecasting, the system risks overstocking or understocking bikes at various locations, leading to operational inefficiencies, diminished user satisfaction, and missed opportunities to enhance urban mobility. 
*This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning to develop robust predictive models for bikesharing demand.*
