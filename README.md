# Problem Background
Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) serves Washington, D.C., and parts of its metropolitan area, operating over 700 stations and managing a fleet of 5,400 bikes as of January 2023. These automated bike rentals enhance urban mobility, reduce environmental impact, and promote health. Since its launch in 2010, CaBi has generated a wealth of data on user behavior and traffic patterns, offering invaluable insights for urban planning and transportation optimization.
Despite its success, CaBi faces challenges in efficiently managing its extensive network of stations and bikes. The unpredictable nature of bike demand, influenced by variables such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal changes, complicates resource allocation. Without accurate demand forecasting, the system risks overstocking or understocking bikes at various locations, leading to operational inefficiencies, diminished user satisfaction, and missed opportunities to enhance urban mobility. 
*This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning to develop robust predictive models for bikesharing demand.*

# Proposed Analysis
Based on the column description of the dataset, we have a target variable. Therefore this project will used a supervised machine learning algorithm, particularly regression models to predict bike rental demands, following these steps:

1. Data Understanding and Cleaning: Analyze the dataset to identify and address missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types. Ensure the data is cleaned and prepared for analysis by handling these issues effectively.

2. Feature and Target Selection: Identify the target variable (y) and the predictor variables (X) for the model. Selecting relevant features is key to improving model performance.

3. Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets, typically in an 80/20 ratio, to train the model and evaluate its performance.

4. Preprocessing: Prepare the data for modeling by scaling, encoding categorical variables, and addressing outliers as needed.

5. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to assess different models or parameter settings, ensuring robust model selection based on performance across multiple data splits.

6. Hyperparameter Optimization: Apply Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance, guided by cross-validation results.

7. Model Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test set using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE to gauge prediction quality.

8. Conclusions: Present key findings, summarize model performance, and highlight insights from the analysis.

9. Recommendations: Offer actionable advice to stakeholders, focusing on optimizing station operations, balancing bike availability, and enhancing overall service efficiency.
